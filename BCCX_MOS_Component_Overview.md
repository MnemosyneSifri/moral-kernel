# 🧬 BCCXGenesis Moral Operating System – Component Overview

This document provides a structured breakdown of the components that make up the **BCCXGenesis Moral Operating System (MOS)**, a framework for programmable ethics, virtue-based reputation, and decentralized moral arbitration.

## 🏛 I. Kernel & Agent Core

| Component             | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `MoralKernel.sol`     | Central contract managing agent identities, virtue scores, and submodule integration. |
| `MoralAgent` (off-chain) | Python-based agent class for simulating on-chain behavior and logging interactions. |
| `CharacterScore`      | Composite moral score combining all virtue data and behavioral patterns. |

## 📜 II. Virtue & Behavior Modules

| Component             | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `VirtueMetrics.sol`   | Tracks individual virtue values: justice, prudence, fortitude, temperance, creativity, etc. |
| `PublicGiving.sol`    | Optional module for altruistic actions like donations, code contributions. |
| `CreativityScore.sol` | Optional module for scoring generative contributions. |
| `TemperanceIndex.sol` *(planned)* | Models moral restraint and ethical moderation over time. |

---

## 🪙 III. Cofung Reputation Engine

| Component             | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `CofungModule.sol`    | Tracks and updates moral capital (cofung) per agent. |
| `StakingModule.sol`   | Optional module to allow moral staking before high-impact actions. |
| `ReputationDecay.sol` *(planned)* | Gradual reduction of scores without sustained moral behavior. |

---

## 📝 IV. Consent & Memory Modules

| Component             | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `ConsentLog.sol`      | Logs mutual or unilateral consent between agents before interaction. |
| `MemoryEthics.sol`    | Records prior moral actions with timestamped decay logic. |
| `DeliberationLog.sol` | Stores reasoning statements, logs of ethical disputes, and agent justifications. |

---

## ⚖️ V. Dispute Resolution & Governance

| Component                  | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `BoveArbitrationModule.sol`| Handles moral disputes using severity, virtue weights, and proportionality logic. |
| `DAOvote.sol`              | On-chain governance for high-stakes disputes, policy voting, and ethical appeals. |
| `EthicalPrecedents.sol` *(planned)* | Stores previous DAO verdicts as reusable case law. |

---

## 🌐 VI. Interfaces & Application Layers

| Component             | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `MoralKernelClient.py`| Local Python simulator for testing agent behavior and MOS logic. |
| `BCCXDAO dApp (UI)`   | Web3 user interface for voting, viewing moral scores, and submitting disputes. |
| `Transparency Dashboard` *(planned)* | Visual frontend to audit virtues, cofungs, and ethical logs. |
