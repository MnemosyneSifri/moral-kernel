## üß¨ What is MoralKernel?

MoralKernel v3.1 is a Solidity-based moral operating system that models each agent‚Äîhuman or AI‚Äîas a fully integrated ethical-psychological entity.

It tracks not just what an agent *does*, but also:
- Why it did it,
- Whether it reflected,
- And how it might grow or regress.
